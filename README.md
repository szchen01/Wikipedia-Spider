# Wikipedia-Spider
Built a web crawler to scrape data from wikipedia with the ability to traverse between different wikipedia pages. Used beautifulsoup library for text-processing of HTML body content and collection of info such as number of palindromes on a page. Currently working on simple neural netwrok to predict article's category from body text.
